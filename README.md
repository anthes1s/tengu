# gui-ffmpeg-converter

So, this should be a video converter using QT+ffmpeg, it's currently in a very poor condition (but at least it does it's job, i just need to polish it a little bit);

TODO:
1. Make a better/user friendly interface; ❌
2. Find a way to be able to choose the video format; ✔️
3. Fix the UI freezing; ✔️
4. Find a way to be able to render multiple files at the same time; ✔️
5. Find a way to keep track of rendering process (0-100%); ❌
6. Create a SETUP where the user will install the ffmpeg and the simple-converter itself ❌
7. Check if FFMPEG is even installed ❌
8. Error handle the TextEdits input ❌ [improvements needed]
9. Make it work on Linux ❌
10. Find a way to limit the CPU (multiple file CPU load goes up to 100% (THIS IS BAD)) ❌
11. Add Random Output File Name Generator; ✔️
