# anthes1s-converter

So, this should be a video converter using QT+ffmpeg, it's currently in a very poor condition (but at least it does it's job, i just need to polish it a little bit);

TODO:
1. Make a better/user friendly interface; ✔️
2. Find a way to be able to choose the video format; ✔️
3. Fix the UI freezing; ✔️
4. Find a way to be able to render multiple files at the same time; ❌
5. Find a way to create a progress bar to let the user know how fast render is going or when it's going to end (check QProcess timers or whatever the fuck it's using when it waits for the process.start to end); ❌
6. Create a SETUP where the user will install the ffmpeg and the simple-converter itself ❌
7. Check if FFMPEG is even installed ❌
8. Error handle the TextEdits input ❌
9. Make it work on Linux ❌
